*** jQuery.XFrame [release-1.0] ***

jQuery.XFrame is a client-side include system built on top of AJAX. It is designed to simplify the development of cache friendly dynamic websites by simplifying the complexity of combining static content with dynamic content (or more generally, content with different caching strategies).

XFrame stands for eXternal Frame. It works a bit like an <iframe> tag, but its much easier to script.
